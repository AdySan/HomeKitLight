# HomeKitLight

This is a followup to the [Christmas Light](https://github.com/AdySan/ChristmasLight) project. This time we’re controlling the light with Siri using HomeKit.

## Features

- Switch On/Off lights using Siri
- USB (phone changer) powered

## Planned features

Just in case the HomeKit control fails, I’d like to have the original functionality as a backup.

- SPIFFS filesystem to store webpages
- File uploads to SPIFFS filesystem via browser
- OTA firmware update (using ArduinoOTA)
- mDNS to advertise host name
